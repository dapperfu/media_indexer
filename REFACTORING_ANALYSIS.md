# Refactoring Analysis Overview

> REQ-072: Documentation is partitioned so that each tracked file stays under the 500-line cap.

The detailed refactoring analysis previously contained in this file is now split into focused documents:

- [Part 1 – Current state and metrics](docs/refactoring_analysis/part1_overview.md)
- [Part 2 – Recommendations and remediation plan](docs/refactoring_analysis/part2_recommendations.md)

Use these links to review the original findings without breaching the new file-size guardrail.
