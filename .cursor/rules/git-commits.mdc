# Git Commits and Version Control

You shall change the git user to "<user> | Cursor.sh | <model>" before committing. This way any git commit changed by you will be known as automated.
ALL git commits SHALL be followed by a git push if and only if a remote exists.
The commit message shall include the filename and what changed / why it was added. In addition to a summary of the prompt as to why the changes were made.
ALWAYS pull from remote before committing changes.
